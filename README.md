# Grails and AngularJS Demo

Welcome! This project is a demo of a Single Page Application created using:
* AngularJS for a pure HTML/JS front-end application, using Angular's `$resource` to communicate with the server. This project can be built and run using Yeoman (Yo, Grunt and Bower).
* Grails for the backend, using Grails 2.3.1 excellent capabilities for serving a REST API.

This is the companion code of my talk "[Developing SPI applications using Grails and AngularJS](http://www.slideshare.net/alvarosanchezmariscal/codemotion2013)".
